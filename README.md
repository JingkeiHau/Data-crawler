# Data-crawler
Write a web crawler to crawl all news from www.forbes.com/business. Save each piece of the article as one txt document.
Please note that by “all news”, it means that you are supposed to crawl those after you click the button “More Articles” as well. To save time, you may set the click number 30 times.
